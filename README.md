## TasteTest 

Taste your test. Or test your taste. 

Another *serious* webapp by me. This was the first app on serviced @deadlyunicorn.art. For its service I used https://www.000webhost.com/. It was my first deployment to the WWW. Not sure why the files that I had on github don't work. Kind of reasonable though, as I was struggling with git then and I also remember ended up deleting all of the project somehow (hopefully while having backedup the main components).

Remaking the APP with Next.js. (Just copy pasting the components)

### Easter Eggs. 

+ At the beginning the menu tells you to press "START" but there is only a "Let's Begin" button. This was intentional and if you  Redo the test 2 times it turns into "START".
+  On the Smiley face page if you find the above easter egg you get a "congrats! you found the easter egg."
+ If you select the *empty* space on the Smash or Pass page, you can clearly see the righ answer.


.. Disclaimer for every of my apps ever made: If you run them and they fry your PC because of a faulty useEffect(), the responsibility is all yours, and I cannot be held accustomed for any damages.

For future reference: some gifs are linked in the CSS file.

..Last note: the code is garbage. I could make it way cleaner.
